# This template will build and test your projects as well as create the documentation.
# 
# * Caches downloaded dependencies and plugins between invocation.
# * Does only verify merge requests but deploy built artifacts of the
#   master branch.
# * Shows how to use multiple jobs in test stage for verifying functionality
#   with multiple JDKs.
# * Uses site:stage to collect the documentation for multi-module projects.
# * Publishes the documentation for `master` branch.

  # This will supress any download for dependencies and plugins or upload messages which would clutter the console log.
  # `showDateTime` will show the passed time in milliseconds. You need to specify `--batch-mode` to make this work.

  # As of Maven 3.3.0 instead of this you may define these options in `.mvn/maven.config` so the same config is used

# This will only validate and compile stuff and run e.g. maven-enforcer-plugin.
